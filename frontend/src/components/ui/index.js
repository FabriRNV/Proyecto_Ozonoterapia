// Importing necessary UI components from their respective files
import Input from "./Input";        // Input component for text input fields
import Select from "./Select";      // Select component for dropdown menus
import TextArea from "./TextArea";  // TextArea component for multi-line text input
import Button from "./Button";      // Button component for clickable actions
import Label from "./Label";        // Label component for form labels
import Card from "./Card";          // Card component for layout purposes

// Exporting the imported components for use in other parts of the application
export {
    Input,     // Exporting Input component
    Select,    // Exporting Select component
    TextArea,  // Exporting TextArea component
    Button,    // Exporting Button component

    Card       // Exporting Card component

/*
  Functionality Overview:
  This module serves as an index file for various UI components. It imports each UI component from its respective file and then exports them together. 
  This approach simplifies the import statements in other parts of the application, allowing developers to import multiple components from a single module rather than importing each one individually.

  Potential Improvements:
  1. **Component Organization:** If the project scales, consider organizing components into folders for better maintainability (e.g., having a 'ui' folder containing all components).
  2. **Type Checking:** Implement PropTypes or TypeScript for better type checking and to ensure that components receive the expected props, improving the robustness of the components.
  3. **Default Exports:** Consider using default exports for individual components if they will be used primarily on their own, which can simplify import statements.
  4. **Index File for Each Component:** Each component could have its own index file to manage imports and exports. This would allow for lazy loading and better optimization.
