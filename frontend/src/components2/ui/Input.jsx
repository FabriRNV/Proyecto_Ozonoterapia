// Input component definition
// This functional component renders a styled input element.
// It uses props to allow for dynamic attributes and behaviors.
export default function Input(props) {
  return (
    // The input element receives various classes for styling,
    // and spreads any additional props provided to it.
    <input
      type="text" // Specifies that this is a text input
      className="bg-gray-100 border text-sm rounded-sm text-black
      focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-blue-500 block w-full p-2.5"
      {...props} // Spread operator to include any other props passed to the component
    />
  )
}

/* 
Possible Improvements:
1. **Type Prop**: Currently, the input type is hardcoded to "text". It could be beneficial to allow the user to specify different input types (e.g., "password", "email", etc.) by accepting a `type` prop.
2. **Placeholder Support**: Consider adding a placeholder prop to improve user experience by guiding input expectations.
3. **Accessibility**: Include an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` prop to improve accessibility for screen readers.
4. **Validation Handling**: It might be useful to handle input validation within the component to ensure the data entered is appropriate and user-friendly.
5. **Default Value**: Support for a `defaultValue` prop would allow the component to be controlled or uncontrolled more easily.
6. **Error State**: Implementing an error state to visually indicate when the input is invalid could enhance usability.
7. **Styling Variants**: Providing different styling options based on props (like primary, secondary, etc.) could make the component more versatile.
